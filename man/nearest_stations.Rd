\title{Find Nearest GSOD Stations to a Specified Latitude and Longitude}
\usage{
nearest_stations(LAT, LON, distance)
}
\arguments{
\item{LAT}{Latitude expressed as decimal degrees (DD) (WGS84)}

\item{LON}{Longitude expressed as decimal degrees (DD) (WGS84)}

\item{distance}{Distance in kilometres from point for which stations are to
be returned.}
}
\value{
A \link[data.table:data.table]{data.table::data.table} with full station metadata including the
distance from the user specified coordinates from nearest to farthest.
}
\description{
Given latitude and longitude values entered as decimal degrees (DD), this
function returns a list (as an atomic vector) of station ID
values, which can be used in\code{\link[=get_GSOD]{get_GSOD()}} to query for specific stations as an
argument in the \code{station} parameter of that function.
}
\note{
The \acronym{GSOD} data, which are downloaded and manipulated by
\CRANpkg{GSODR} stipulate that the following notice should be given.
